# Problem 3: Initializing Floating Types in Kotlin

**Objective:**
Create a Kotlin file named "FloatingTypes.kt" to explore and understand the behavior of floating-point data types in Kotlin.

**Instructions:**

### 1. Setting up the Playground:
- Start by creating a new Kotlin file named "FloatingTypes.kt."
- Ensure that there is no existing code in the file.

### 2. Creating a Double Variable:
- Declare a variable named `circleRatio` and assign the value `3.14` to it.
- Print out the value of `circleRatio` to the console.

> *Hint: Hover over the variable to identify the data type that Kotlin infers.*

### 3. Transition to Float:
- Modify `circleRatio` to be of type `float` by adding an `F` at the end of its value.
- Print the variable again.

> *Hint: Check the data type again. Has it changed?*

### 4. Precision Testing:
- Attempt to assign a more precise value to `circleRatio`, such as `3.1415926535F`.
- Observe any errors or warnings.

> *Hint: Remember, `float` has limitations on the precision it can store.*

### 5. Switching to Double for Precision:
- Remove the `F` from the end of `circleRatio`'s value to change its type back to `double`.
- Assign an even longer value to `circleRatio`, like `3.1415926535897932`.
- Print out `circleRatio` and observe the result.

> *Hint: Compare the precision of this value to the previous `float` value. Notice the difference in precision capabilities between `double` and `float`.*

**Final Step:**
You have now explored the characteristics of floating-point data types in Kotlin, comparing the precision of `float` and `double`. Observe the impact of data type changes on precision and gain insights into their behavior in Kotlin.
