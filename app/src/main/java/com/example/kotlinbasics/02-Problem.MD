# Problem: Setting up the Kotlin Playground

**Objective:**
Create a Kotlin file named "VariableTypes.kt" to practice declaring and working with both immutable and mutable variables.

**Instructions:**

1. **Declaring an Immutable Variable:**
    - Create a constant variable named `constantNumber` using the `val` keyword.
    - Assign an integer value to `constantNumber`.

   > *Hint: `val` is used for variables whose value remains constant.*

2. **Declaring a Mutable Variable:**
    - Declare a mutable variable named `mutableString` using the `var` keyword.
    - Assign a string value to `mutableString`.

   > *Hint: `var` allows the variable's value to be changed over time.*

3. **Printing Variables:**
    - Utilize the `println` function to print the values of both `constantNumber` and `mutableString`.

   > *Hint: Directly pass the variable names to `println`.*

4. **Modifying and Reprinting Mutable Variable:**
    - Change the value of `mutableString` to a different string.
    - Print the updated value of `mutableString` using `println`.

   > *Hint: This step illustrates the mutability aspect of variables declared with `var`.*

**Final Step:**
You have successfully practiced working with both immutable (`val`) and mutable (`var`) variables in Kotlin. Your final code should showcase the declaration of both `val` and `var`, along with print statements displaying their values before and after modification (for `var`).
