# Problem: Setting up Booleans Playground

**Objective:**
Create a Kotlin file named "BooleansPractice.kt" to practice declaring boolean variables and performing logical operations.

**Instructions:**

### 1. Setting up the Playground:
- Start by creating a new Kotlin file named "BooleansPractice.kt."

### 2. Step 1: Declaring Boolean Variables:
- Declare a variable named `myTrue` and assign the value `true` to it.
- Similarly, declare a variable named `myFalse` and assign the value `false` to it.

> *Hint: Remember that the words 'true' and 'false' are special keywords in Kotlin.*

### 3. Step 2: Logical OR Operation:
- Using the `println` function, evaluate the OR operation between `myTrue` and `myFalse`. Observe the output.

> *Hint: Use the `||` symbol for the OR operation. The result will be true if either of the two booleans is true.*

### 4. Step 3: Logical AND Operation:
- Use the `println` function again, but this time, evaluate the AND operation between `myTrue` and `myFalse`.

> *Hint: Use the `&&` symbol for the AND operation. The result will be true only if both booleans are true.*

### 5. Step 4: Logical NOT Operation:
- Lastly, print the negation of `myTrue`.

> *Hint: Use the `!` symbol to negate the boolean value.*

### 6. Step 5: Understanding Inline Comments:
- Add inline comments next to each of your `println` statements, predicting the output.
- For example: `// This will be true`

> *Hint: Inline comments in Kotlin start with double slashes `//` and won't be executed by the compiler.*

**Final Step:**
You have successfully practiced declaring boolean variables and performing logical operations in Kotlin. Observe the output of the operations and enhance your understanding of boolean expressions.
