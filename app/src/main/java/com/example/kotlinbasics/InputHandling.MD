# Problem: Input Handling in Kotlin

**Objective:**
Create a Kotlin file named "InputHandling.kt" to practice user input handling and basic arithmetic operations.

**Instructions:**

### 1. Setting up the Playground:
- Start by creating a new Kotlin file named "InputHandling.kt."
- Ensure that there is no existing code.

### 2. Step 1: Prompt User for Input:
- Write a `main` function where you will write your code.
- Use `println` to prompt the user to enter a number. For example: "Please enter a number: ".

### 3. Step 2: Read User Input:
- After the prompt, use the `readln()` function to read the user's input and store it in a variable named `inputString`.

> *Hint: `readln()` reads the input as a string.*

### 4. Step 3: Convert String to Integer:
- Convert `inputString` to an integer and store it in a variable named `inputNumber`.
- Use the `toInt()` function for conversion.

> *Hint: Make sure to handle potential exceptions when the user input is not a valid integer.*

### 5. Step 4: Perform Arithmetic Operation:
- Declare another integer variable with a predefined value (e.g., `val multiplier = 5`).
- Perform a simple arithmetic operation (like multiplication) between `inputNumber` and your predefined variable.
- Print the result of this operation.

> *Hint: You can print something like "Result of operation is: " followed by the result.*

**Final Step:**
You have successfully practiced user input handling and performed a basic arithmetic operation in Kotlin. Observe the interaction between user input and program output.
